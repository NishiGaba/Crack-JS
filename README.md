This is the Perfect Developer Roadmap that guides you through the Front-End, Back End and DevOps Developer Path.
If you want to dig deep into this, just follow this link: [developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). After choosing the path to development, now we can go further with the step-by-step development from basics to advanced concepts.
